        <h2>Why I Chose the Path of Data & Analytics</h2>
        <div class="why-content">
             <p>Every journey begins with curiosity, mine began with a fascination for how technology shapes the world around us. During my bachelor’s in Information Science & Engineering, I developed a strong foundation in IT systems, algorithms, and architecture. But what truly ignited my passion was not just how systems operate but how they produce and rely on data to make smarter decisions.</p>
            
            <p>My curiosity turned into clarity when I joined a fast-paced startup as a Data Engineer and Analyst. Unlike rigid roles, this experience immersed me in diverse projects across multiple clients, where I had the unique opportunity to build real-time data pipelines, automate reporting, and design dashboards that directly supported operational decisions. I witnessed firsthand how data can drive clarity, agility, and growth from reducing downtime and increasing system performance to delivering insights that shaped business outcomes. I wasn’t just solving problems I was influencing results.</p>
            
            <p>This hands-on exposure sparked a deeper realization: to truly maximize the power of data, I needed to understand both the technical foundation and the business context. That realization led me to pursue a Master’s in Management Information Systems, where I explored the intersection of technology and strategy. Here, I honed skills in data-driven decision-making, business intelligence, and digital transformation, learning how organizations can evolve by aligning technology with goals.</p>
            
            <p>Today, I see data as more than just a byproduct of systems I see it as an engine for progress. My mission is to help organizations harness that power to architect pipelines, uncover insights, and turn complexity into clarity. With a unique blend of engineering precision and business intuition, I am committed to building solutions that not only solve problems but elevate possibilities.</p>
